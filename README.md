#  RoamMobile

RoamMobile is simple webview app for RoamReseach. 

~~One thing that annoy me when using Roam on mobile browser is it's automatically zoom in when focusing on textinput. This app solves that.~~ (They fixed it already.)

## Features

* URL scheme on `roammobile://` to quickly open the app. You can use this urlscheme and paired with Shortcuts to quickly open web pages or any other content

## TODO
[ ] Enable default database settings so no need to pick which database upon opening
[ ] Enable top and bottom custom color so it'll match with user's custom theme on Roam

Suggestions, feature request or feedbacks are highly appreciated! 🙇🏻‍♂️

Also, now you can buy me a coffee 🎉
